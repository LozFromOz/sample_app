<h1>Digital Advertising</h1>
<p>Customer acquisition costs money.  Advertising costs money. The great thing for start-ups and small business is that low costs of digital advertising allows you to complete with the big brands. Traditional advertsing can be expensive, billboards, television TCV, radio can cost a few K's (or more).

<h3>PPC (AdWords) </h3>
<p>PPC marketing is not only accountable for ROI, it's measurable too.
Here's an example of an ideal situation </p>
<ol>
<li>Meagan uses 'keywords' to search for information on glasses chains as a gist for Mother's Day.</li>
<li>Meagan sees an ad for glasses chains and clicks it.</li>
<li>Speclace a glasses chain company pays a set cost for the click. Speclace usually has a CPC of $0.60</li>
<li>Meagan's click takes her to Speclace's landing page created specifically for a "glasses chain" search.</li>
<li>Meagan determines in 3 seconds or less whether she has 'landed' on the right page.</li>
<li> Meagan decides to purchase <a href="http://www.specklace.com.au/Specklaces/Jungle_Range/Tiger_Swirl.php">Tiger Swirl</a> for her Mother.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Speclace was diligent enough to make sure that the landing page created a high quality and relevant user experience.</p> Relevant landing pages reduce bounce rates, where the customer exits the page soon after viewing it.</p>
<h4>Quotes from other marketers</h4>
<i>The best CTRs I've experienced come from specific Ad Groups & relevant ad copy leading to relevant landing pages</i>

<h3>Facebook Advertising Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Increase Relevant Page Likes:</b> Relevant likes come from people actually interested in your offer who willingly clicked like. Facebook likes means that users see your social media content in their newsfeed.</p>  Expect to pay anywhere from $.20 to $1.00 per relevant Facebook Like.</li>
  <li><p><b>Increase Traffic to your site:</b> 
  Use promoted posts. Promoted posts are prioritised to reach non-Fans in Facebook's sidebar and reach fans in the newsfeed that have missed the initial post.<p>Run your ads at a frequency that doesn't create apathy with you audience. This may be 3-4 times a week. Expect to reach about 20% of your Fans that have missed the initial post.
