<h1>Digital Advertising</h1>
<p>Customer acquisition costs money.  Advertising costs money. The great thing for start-ups and small business is that the low cost of digital advertising allows you to complete with the big brands. Traditional advertsing can be expensive. Television TCV,  billboards, radio can cost a few  thousand K's (or more).</p>
<p> Medium to Large businesses are now realising the value of digital marketing. Digital marketing is cost effective, measurable and is the most accurate medium to measure return on investment (ROI).

<h3>PPC (AdWords) </h3>
<p>PPC marketing is not only accountable for ROI,  the knowledged gained can be leveraged to aid other digital strategies as well.
Here's an PPC example of an ideal ecommerce situation. </p>
<ol>
<li>Meagan uses 'keywords' to search for information on glasses chains as a gift for Mother's Day.</li>
<li>Meagan sees an ad for glasses chains and clicks it.</li>
<li>Speclace a business that sells glasses chain pays a fixed cost for the click. Speclace usually has a cost-per-click (CPC) of $0.60</li>
<li>Meagan's click takes her to Speclace's landing page created specifically for a "glasses chain" search.</li>
<li>Meagan determines in 3 seconds or less whether she has 'landed' on the right page.
<p><%=image_tag("landing_page.jpg", alt: "Speclace landing page is relevant to the keyword glassses chains")%></p>
</li>
<li> Meagan decides to purchase <a href="http://www.specklace.com.au/Specklaces/Jungle_Range/Tiger_Swirl.php">Tiger Swirl</a> for her Mother.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Speclace was diligent enough to make sure that the landing page created a high quality and relevant user experience. Relevant landing pages reduce bounce rates, where the customer exits the page soon after viewing it. Relevant landing pages also improve the Ad's quailty score which means your advertisment has a greater chance of achieving a better ranked position on the search engine results page (SERP). Higher Quality scores are worth striving for because you can reduce your advertising costs whilst maintaining great positioning.

<h3>Facebook Advertising Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Increase Relevant Page Likes:</b> Relevant likes come from people actually interested in your offer who willingly clicked like. Facebook likes mean that users frequently see your social media content in their newsfeed. This is a great way to remain top of mind for your target audience and therefore improved brand familiarity, recall and recognition.</p>  Expect to pay anywhere from $.20 to $1.00 per relevant Facebook Like.</li>
  <li><p><b>Increase Traffic to your site:</b> 
  Use promoted posts. Promoted posts are prioritised to reach non-Fans in Facebook's sidebar and reach fans in the newsfeed that have missed the initial post.<p>Run your ads at a frequency that doesn't create apathy with your audience. This may be 3-4 times a week. Expect to reach about 20% of your Fans that have missed the initial post.
